# Express-server-boilerplate
I created this repo to set up a basic express server boilerplate in E6 and bootsrapped my project with eslint airbnb style guide.

## Requirements
Ensure that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your local machine. And you are familiar with git basics which include creating a repo on Github, forking an existing repository and cloning a repository. If those are totally new concepts to you please check out this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHaTbJPdB-s&t=79s)

## Set up guide
- Fork this repo and use it as a template for any repo you want to set up an express server. 
- Then clone your repo in your local machine and open it on any text editor of your choice.
- On the terminal run the command ```npm init -y``` to initialize your project.
- And to install all dependencies listed in _package.json_ run the command ``npm i `` on your terminal.

## Starting the server
 On the terminal run the command ``npm start`` to get your server started.
